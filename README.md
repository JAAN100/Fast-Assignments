# LAbs
Write a C-Program to swap two integer numbers without and with 
using third variable.




Exercise 2:
Print the following series using for loop:
a. Print numbers from 1 to 100 with increment of 1
b. Print numbers from 100 to 1 with decrement of 1
c. Print numbers from 20 to 2 in steps of -2
d. Print sequence of numbers: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20
e. Print sequence of numbers: 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, 44, 33, 22, 11, 0





Exercise 3:
Write a program that reads in five integers and then determines and prints the largest and
smallest integers in the group. Use only the techniques you have learnt so far, and make sure
that the program only uses three variables. (Hint: use two of the variables to hold the current
largest and smallest integers.)
