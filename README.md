Problem 1: In a town, the percentage of men is 52.The percentage of total literacy is 48.If total 
percentage of literate men is 35 of the total population, write a program to find the total 
number of illiterate men and women if the population of town is 80,000.


Problem 2: When Cheryl Harrison began her trip from New York to Wyoming; she filled her car’s tank 
with gas and reset its trip meter to zero. After traveling 324 miles, Cheryl stopped at a gas 
station to refuel; the gas tank required 17 gallons. Cheryl wants a program that calculates 
and displays her car’s gas mileage at any time during the trip. The gas mileage is the 
number of miles her car was driven per gallon of gas. Write a C code that can implement 


Problem 3: The manager of the Lakeview Hotel wants a program that calculates and displays a guest's 
total bill. Each guest pays a room charge that is based on a per-night rate. For example if 
the per night rate is $100 and the guest stays two nights, the room charge is 
$200.Customer also may incur a one-time room service charge and a one-time telephone 
charge


Problem 4: Write a c code that will calculate the roots of a quadratic equation �! + �� + � = 0
Hint: d = sqrt (b2
-4ac), and the roots are: x1 = (–b + d)/2a and x2 = (–b – d)/2a (use sqrt 
function from cmath.h 



Problem 5: Hero’s Formula is A method for calculating the area of a triangle when you know the 
lengths of all three sides. Let a, b, c be the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The area is 
given by:
� = *�(� − �)(� − �)(� − �)
where
� = � + � + �




Problem 6: Area of a trapezoid can be calculated by the following formula:
� = (�1 + �2) ×
"
!
where b1 and b2 are the parallel sides or the bases and h is length of height
Write a C-language code to calculate area of a trapezoid using above method. Take 
required inputs from the user and display the area that your code calculates.




Problem 7: Write a C code which can calculate volume of the 3D objects i.e. box, prism, cylinder and 
sphere. Take necessary inputs from the user and display the results.
• ������ �� � ��� = � × � × ℎ
l= length, w= width, h = height
• ������ �� � ��ℎ��� = #
$
× � × �$
r = radius of sphere
• ������ �� � ����� = ���� × �
���� = 1
2
× � × ℎ
b = length of the base of the triangle, h = height of the triangle, H = height of the 
triangular prism
• ������ �� � �������� = � × �! × �
r = radius of the circle of the base, H = height of the cylinder




Problem 8: Write a C code to evaluate the following series up to three significant digits 
sin(x) = x − (x3 / 3!) + (x5 / 5!) − (x7 / 7!) . . .



Problem 9: Write a C function 
a) to compute the distance between two points A and B where each point has two 
values x and y. i.e. A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2).
�������� = � = *(�! − �&)! + (�! − �&)!
b) Modify the code in part a) and calculate the distance between 3 points. You 
have to calculate the distance between A and B, B and C, and finally between A and C. 
Now consider that these three points are forming a triangle. Develop a logic that can lead 
to calculate the area of this triangle. Implement your logic in C language. Take necessary 
inputs and display the results



Problem 10: For the following set of sample data, compute the standard deviation and mean.
X = -6, -12, 8, 13, 11, 6, 7, 2, -6, -9, -10, 11, 10, 9, 2
